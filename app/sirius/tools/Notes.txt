Steps for building a full database.

1. rebuild_mongo_database.py will automatically download, parse, and upload several data sets to the MongoDB.
   To make it relatively light-weight, only the first 5 of 1067 ENCODE datasets are downloaded by default.
   Also, the dbSNP dataset containing 37 M SNPs is not downloaded by default.
   This will allow keeping the size of MongoDB < 10GB after this step.

2. To complete the downloading of all ENCODE datasets, one can use this command:
   ./automate_encode_upload.py -s 5 -e 1067
   This will download all the rest of the ENCODE datasets, then parse and upload them one by one.
   This step will add 1000 M GenomeNodes for intervals to MongoDB, and will take several hours to finish.

Finishing all steps will end up with a MongoDB potentially taking 100GB or more.
